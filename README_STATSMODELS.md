## 💡 Why Statsmodels is Important

**Statsmodels** provides a level of detail and rigor that is essential for reporting statistical findings. Its focus is on providing the full statistical context, standard errors, confidence intervals, and detailed diagnostic tables that are standard in research papers and econometrics.

* **Inference over Prediction:** Focus is on understanding the **coefficients** and their significance.
* **Robust Diagnostics:** Excellent tools for checking if the model assumptions (like normality, homoscedasticity) are met.
